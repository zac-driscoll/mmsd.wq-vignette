<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> get_survey_data()</h2>
<p>The core function in mmsd.wq is <strong>get_survey_data</strong>. This function
is used to query and process water quality data from the LIMS server. This is
done by first creating ODBC connections with relevant databases
(e.g LIMS_exchange and FreshwaterMonitoring). Once connected, <strong>get_survey_data</strong>
utilizes a SQL function (fFreshwaterMonitoringOpSID) written by Kevin Moore,
along with other basic SQL queries to retrieve data. R code is used to customize
queries and to perform post-processing.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> ODBC Connections</h2>
<p>The <em>get_survey_data</em> functions relies on ODBC connections to retrieve
data from databases. A connection can be made using the <em>make_dBConnection()</em>
function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="get-data.html#cb2-1"></a><span class="co">#make a connection to the &quot;LIMS_Exchange&quot; database</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="get-data.html#cb2-2"></a>LIMS &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">make_dBConnection</span>(<span class="dt">database =</span> <span class="st">&quot;LIMS&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="get-data.html#cb2-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="get-data.html#cb2-4"></a><span class="co">#make a connection to the &quot;FreshwaterMontoring&quot; database</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="get-data.html#cb2-5"></a>freshwater &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">make_dBConnection</span>(<span class="dt">database =</span> <span class="st">&quot;freshwater&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once connections are made, they can be passed to the <em>get_survey_data</em> arguments
to retrieve data. Both a connection to the “LIMS_Exchange” and
“FreshwaterMonitoring” databases are required.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="get-data.html#cb3-1"></a>wq_data &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">get_survey_data</span>(<span class="dt">LIMS_con =</span> <span class="st">&quot;LIMS&quot;</span>,<span class="dt">fw_con =</span> <span class="st">&quot;freshwater&quot;</span>,</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="get-data.html#cb3-2"></a>                           <span class="dt">survey_num =</span> <span class="st">&quot;SS 400&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It is best practice to close ODBC connections at the end of every session. This
can be done using the <em>odbc</em> package.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="get-data.html#cb4-1"></a>odbc<span class="op">::</span><span class="kw">dbDisconnect</span>(freshwater)</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="get-data.html#cb4-2"></a>odbc<span class="op">::</span><span class="kw">dbDisconnect</span>(LIMS)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If database connections are not provided to the <em>get_survey_function</em> these
will be made internally within the function. These connections will be
closed after making all necessary queries. As a check, messages will be printed
indicating that these connections were made then closed.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="get-data.html#cb5-1"></a>wq_data &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">get_survey_data</span>(<span class="dt">survey_num =</span> <span class="st">&quot;SS 400&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;LIMS Database Connection open before query?:  TRUE&quot;
## [1] &quot;LIMS Database connection open after query?:  FALSE&quot;
## [1] &quot;Freshwater Database Connection open before query?:  TRUE&quot;
## [1] &quot;Freshwater Database connection open after query?:  FALSE&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="output-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Output Data</h2>
<p>The output of the get_survey_data is a dataframe containing water
quality data and it’s associated meta data. The function works by joining
the raw query output returned from the “fFreshwaterMonitoringOpSID” SQL
function to internal package lookup tables and tables from SQL databases.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Query Parameters</h2>
<p><em>get_survey_data</em> has several arguments that can be used to refine a
query. A “start_date” and “end_date”, “survey_num”, or sample_sid<br />
are required. All other arguments are optional. Multiple arguments can be
used to create a specific query. Built in error checking code limits the user
from creating nonsensical queries. The following sections show how to use the
different arguments to refine queries.</p>
<div id="date-range" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> Date Range</h3>
<p>The “start_date” and “end_date” arguments can be used to retrieve data

and need to be formatted as “YYYY-MM-DD” (e.g. “2020-10-31”).</p>

<p>Data for an individual survey can be retrieved by using the <em>survey_num</em>

without depth can be passed to the sitecode argument to retrieve all depths
associated with that site. For example, passing “OH-01” will retrieve data
